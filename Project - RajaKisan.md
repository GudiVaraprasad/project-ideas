> Project Idea : Project RajaKisan

> Problem Statement : 
- As the world population is increasing due to which land water and resources becoming insufficient to continue the demand-supply chain. So, we need a smarter approach and become more efficient about how we farm and can be most productive.
- Technical Advancements in Agriculture.

> Features : 
- Connecting a Producer(Farmer), Consumer(People), Workers, and Agro-based Industries.
- The Farmers can sell their products through online and the customer can buy that product.
- Workers can update their details and farmers can view Applied Workers profile and they can hire them.
- The industries can host events on educating farmers in producing fertile crops, implementing Technology in Agriculture, and promote sustainable development.
- AI in Agriculture
  - Soil and crop health monitoring system.
  - Companies (AI/ML Engineers) getting in-touch with farmers.
  - Usage of Bots/Drones for monitoring.


> Success metrics : 
- Will be able to provide job opportunities - Increase in employement.
- Artificial Intelligence in agriculture not only helping farmers to automate their farming but also shifts to precise cultivation for higher crop yield and better quality while using fewer resources.
- Literacy rate by educating, spreading awareness.
- Saving Water, eating chemical free food.

> Extras : 
- Investment by NGOs, welfare organizations, Government, Industries.
- Can AI replace the knowledge that farmers have always had? The response is probably no for now- but definitely in the near future. Such technological interventions are likely to lead to better agricultural practices, yields, and qualitatively improve the lives of Farmers/Nation.
- If AI, then why employment? everything can't be done with AI nor with Man Power. Mixed produces wonderful results.
